# Workshop: Models in genomics and biodiversity analysis

- Xia Hua (Australian National University)

This workshop will introduce some basic mathematical models in population genomics, phylogenomics, and phylodynamics. Some of these models are relevant to the afternoon workshops, including species distribution models in biodiversity and spatial analysis, multi-species coalescence process and birth-death process in phylogenomics, and regression models in genome-wide association studies. The workshop will focus on the mathematical foundations of these models, so that participants will have a rough idea on how to develop a mathematical model for their own studies. No software is required for this workshop. Participants are assumed to have a basic understanding of calculus, probability, and statistics.
